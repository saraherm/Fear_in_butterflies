Adventures in scaring butterflies in 2016

Code and datasets associated with summer of 2016 field experiment at field FC2 in East Lansing, Michigan. Field Study ran from June 6-Aug 6, 2016. 

To assess the influence of predators and predator odors on herbivore colonization, population growth and crop yield, we set-up a large field experiment with three treatments: control (unmanipulated), chemical cue (chemical blend from H. axyridis, as described above) or live predator (five H. axyridis adults placed in a mesh bag fastened to the uppermost fully extended leaf on the collard plant). Our experiment was conducted on a 135 x 60 m plot of land at the Michigan State University Entomology Research Farm in Ingham County, East Lansing, MI, USA (42.691, -84.490). The land was sub-divided into 21 experimental plots, measuring 10 x 10 m, each separated from other plots as well as the field edge by 10 m (Figure 1A). To prepare the field for planting, the land was first disced on 26 May 2016, fertilized on 8 June, 2016, cultivated on 10 June, 2016 and grass seed (Quick-2-Gro Earth Carpet Lawn Seed, LaCrosse Seed, Lansing, MI) was spread (4lbs/1000ft2) on 14 June, 2016. 

Data analysis was conducted in collaboration with C.Bahlai.
